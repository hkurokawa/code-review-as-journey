# The story of code review

^OK.  Let's take a look at a typical code review flow.  And, here, I am using an analogy - a journey.
^Code review is like a journey.  You are handed over a map with a route on it, a Pull Request, and you walk down to the goal following the route, verifying how good the change is.

# 1. Understand the Background and the Goal

^When you have a map, what you have to do in the first place is understanding the goal and the background.
^Where you have to go?  Why you have to get there?
^If you start walking without knowing where the goal is or what the background of your journey is, I am sure you cannot tell whether or not the route on the map is correct and you might get lost.
^So remember to make sure what the goal and the background is before starting your journey.

# 2. Go through the strategy and what was made

^OK.  Now you can start!  Let's walk!  No, no.  A well experienced traveller checks the map and the route before starting his or her journey.
^Of course, you do not need to check the route in details.  But it is really good to have a rough idea on the route.  Does the route head to the east or the west?  Does it avoid a mountain or climb up the mountain?
